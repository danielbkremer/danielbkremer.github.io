      <p>Currently based in Pasadena, California, Daniel Kremer is a filmmaker, film historian, biographer, professional film archivist, veteran home video audio commentator, and DVD/Blu-Ray extras producer. In 2007, as a film student at Temple University, he directed his first feature-length film <a class="imdb-link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2447670/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophisticated Acquaintance</a> (2007), on the subject of author Klaus Mann, and was presented with four national prizes for his short documentary about having grown up with a severe stutter. His second feature <a class="imdb-link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270796/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Trip to Swadades</a> (2008), which was shot on super-16mm film, won three Best Film awards.
